Markdown and code for gRaphics Workshop Oikos 2021


Hello and welcome to Oikos 2021! 
If this is one of your first times using R, please take a look at the Oikos_Package_Install.md 
to help you download packages before our workshop on Feb. 1st 2021.

If you had an error in your code or are here after a coffee break to catch up on code, please take a look
at either the Oikos_Workshop.md or Oikos_Workshop.pdf files to get an exact script of what I have been using. 

If you have the time, I recommend writing out the code line-by-line instead of copy and pasting!
This process really helped me learn when I was starting out. 

Feel free to send me an email (chloe.a.fouilloux (at) gmail.com) if you need any further assistance.

Best, 
Chloe
